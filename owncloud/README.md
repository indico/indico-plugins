# OwnCloud integration plugin

This plugin enables integration with an ownCloud server, initially for the
purpose of attaching materials to an event or category. A new "from the cloud"
button shows up in the materials section which enables a manager to log into his
ownCloud account and pick files from his personal storage. Those files will be
copied as attachments.
