# Manual Payment Plugin

This plugin provides a "manual" payment option for Indico's payment module which
is typically used for payments via Bank Transfer. It allows event organizers to
define a custom text with various placeholders to provide information on how to
make a payment or even link to an external payment service that has no deeper
integration with Indico.
