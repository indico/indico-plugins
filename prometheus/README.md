# Indico Prometheus Plugin

This plugin exposes a `/metrics` endpoint which provides Prometheus-compatible output.

## prometheus.yml
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: indico_stats
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scheme: https
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - yourindicoserver.example.com
    # it is recommended that you set a bearer token in the config
    authorization:
        credentials: xxxxxx
    # this is only needed in development setups
```

If you're doing development you may want to add this under `scrape_configs`:
```yaml
    tls_config:
      insecure_skip_verify: false
```
