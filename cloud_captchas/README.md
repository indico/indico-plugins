# Cloud CAPTCHAs Plugin

This plugin replaces the built-in CAPTCHA with Google's reCAPTCHA v2 or hCaptcha.

This plugin also serves as an example for developers who want to use a different
CAPTCHA for their Indico instance.

## Setup

The plugin requires you to set the site key and secret key on the plugin settings page.

When using reCaptcha these keys can be created on the [reCAPTCHA admin dashboard][recaptcha-create].
Choose **reCAPTCHA v2** and **"I'm not a robot" Checkbox**.

When using hCaptcha the keys can be created on the [hCaptcha dashboard][hcaptcha-dashboard].
