# Legacy Themes plugin

This plugin contains the "Compact style" (`nicecompact`) theme for Indico events:

![Compact style](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indico/indico-plugins/master/themes_legacy/theme-nicecompact.png)

We consider the look and feel of this theme very outdated and no longer up to
our standards, but as some users may still want to use this theme, we provide
this plugin in order to keep it alive.

This plugin needs to be installed explicitly; it is not part of the `indico-plugins`
meta package as we do not recommend anyone setting up Indico to make this theme
available - its sole purpose is to not force existing users of the theme to stop
using it when an instance is upgraded to 3.0.

## Changelog

### 3.2

- Update translations

### 3.0

- Initial release for Indico 3.0
