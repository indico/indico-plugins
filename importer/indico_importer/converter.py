class RecordConverter(object):
    """
    Converts a dictionary or list of dictionaries into another list of dictionaries. The goal
    is to alter data fetched from connector class into a format that can be easily read by importer
    plugin. The way dictionaries are converted depends on the 'conversion' variable.

    conversion = [ (sourceKey, destinationKey, conversionFuncion(optional), converter(optional))... ]

    It's a list tuples in which a single element represents a translation that will be made. Every
    element of the list is a tuple that consists of from 1 to 4 entries.

    The first one is the key name in the source dictionary, the value that applies to this key will
    be the subject of the translation. The second is the key in the destination dictionary at which
    translated value will be put. If not specified its value will be equal the value of the first
    element. If the second element is equal *append* and the converted element is a dictionary or a
    list of dictionaries, destination dictionary will be updated by the converted element.Third,
    optional, element is the function that will take the value from the source dictionary and return
    the value which will be inserted into result dictionary. If the third element is empty
    defaultConversionMethod will be called.  Fourth, optional, element is a RecordConverter class
    which will be executed with converted value as an argument.
